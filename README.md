Work in progress to add networking capability to the xv6 OS with the NE2000 network card. Loosely inspired by the [xv6-network](https://github.com/s-shin/xv6-network) and [xv6-lwip-capabilities](https://github.com/phulin/xv6-lwip-capabilities) projects. 

For more information on xv6, check out [MIT's xv6 repo](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public).
